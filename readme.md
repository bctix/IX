# IX

another rewrite?
yea

its mainly just to reorganize some stuff, i updated the framework i used a lot and this project fell behind and ended up getting more confusing

im rewriting it to hopefully make it easier to read, and easier to setup for other people to use!
it will only be released when every feature is recreated

its not *exactly* a rewrite, but more of a copy paste with better organization
